# Algorithms & Data Structure Projects done in C
ðŸ’» Algorithm related work done in C from COMP10002 and COMP20003

ðŸ‘€ These are some of the work done as school projects  

âœ… Updates might be delayed as code can only be released after grades are released.

## âœ… FOA Project 1 : Text Processing with C

Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and now the highly infectious Omicron variant! The SARS-CoV-2 (a.k.a., COVID-19) virus has kept mutating, creating new variants continuously. But how do scientists track the different variants of the virus? In this assignment, we will take a sneak peek at a key step in the virus variant tracking process â€“ mapping the genome of a new variant to that of a reference genome (i.e., the genome of a reference virus), which helps identify the genes that have mutated in the vari- ant comparing with the reference virus.

## âœ… ADS Project 1 : Building a dictionary using linked list  

In this assignment, you will create a simple dictionary based on a linked list to store information from a dataset about the City of Melbourne. A user will be able to search this dictionary to retrieve information about footpaths in Melbourne using attributes in the dataset (keys). 

Your implementation will build the dictionary by reading the data from a file and inserting each footpath record as a node in a linked list. You will also implement a method to search for a key in the list, outputting any records that match the key. Note that keys are not guaranteed to be unique!
